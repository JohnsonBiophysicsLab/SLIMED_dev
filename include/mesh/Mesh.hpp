     * compute the area and volume of the element.
     *
     * If `nOneRingVertex` is equal to 11, the face corresponds to an irregular patch. In this case,
     * the method again calls `get_one_ring_vertex_matrix` to compute the matrix of one-ring vertex
     * coordinates, but then performs multiple iterations of subdivision using the `M`, `M1`, `M2`,
     * `M3`, and `M4` matrices to estimate the area and volume of the element.
